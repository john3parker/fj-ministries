# Trusting God With Your Heart

Consider the opening verses of Habakkuk in the easy reading paraphrase of the Message: 

` God, how long do I have to cry out for help before you listen? How many times do I have to yell, “Help! Murder! Police!” before you come to the rescue? `
<!--break-->
`Why do you force me to look at evil, stare trouble in the face day after day? Anarchy and violence break out, quarrels and fights all over the place. Law and order fall to pieces. Justice is a joke. The wicked have the righteous hamstrung and stand justice on its head.`

Here’s Habakkuk, a prophet of God, so inspired by God that he becomes one of the prophets included in the 
Bible. I think we often see such people as **very holy** and perhaps as though they aren’t human in the way we are. But consider what he is saying and the emotion in the words. Can you not picture someone saying these words while raising a fist at God? Habakkuk basically is saying, "God you are failing at being God" and that God’s “justice” is a joke!” Habakkuk is angry and disappointed at God. I know I have felt this way at times; have you?

As you continue to read the prophet’s writing (only 3 chapters and a short 10 minute read), there is no lightning bolt from the sky striking Habakkuk. Instead, God woos him, meeting him where he is, and ultimately Habakkuk sees the truth of who God is and exclaims:
`“I’m singing joyful praise to God. I’m turning cartwheels of joy to my Savior God. Counting on God’s Rule to prevail, I take heart and gain strength. I run like a deer. I feel like I’m king of the mountain!”`

I pray that we all can learn to take our whole heart and mind to God, no matter what we are thinking or feeling, because God’s love doesn’t stop just because we are angry or disappointed, even at or with God! The entire world right now is experiencing grief, loss, and discomfort from COVID-19 (on top of other things any of us were carrying before), and it would be natural to blame or be disappointed in God during this time. God truly is big enough to take your biggest punch. In fact, just like I long for my kids to come to me, even when they are mad at me, God is no different. God longs for our honest feelings and deep intimacy with us. God would love to hear from you, no matter what you are feeling, and God would love to have a chance to reveal his love for you in the midst of your pain.
