# Family DTS Staff

This week Dr. Stephen Sim and his wife took us to breakfast to share their heart for our time of teaching in Korea. They shared how many Korean churches use shame and  eligious duties to control Korean believers and that many of the younger generation are leaving the church. They also shared that it is so important for someone to have professional credentials and education to be respected.

Consequently, the fact that Tara and I are both professionals and articulate speakers about God’s grace led them to ask us to come to their city to share the love of God. I am so blessed to be asked and plan to share from Genesis and Luke 15 about God’s Father’s heart.
