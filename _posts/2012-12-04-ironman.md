# Kathleen McCartney

Our family helps with the Ironman World Championships most years, as do thousands of others in our community. This year Regan thought it would be neat to run a mile with an Ironman athlete <!--break-->to encourage them. I (Tara) prayed with her about who the right person would be. In the distance we saw a woman and Regan said, I think she's the one. She met and ran with Kathleen McCartney, who told her she forgot her watch that day and that her back was hurting. Regan prayed for her and then ran back to our aid station.

She got Maribel's watch and ran several more miles to catch her and give her the watch. We found Kathleen after the race, and learned that she was a famous athlete who had won the Ironman in 1982! She took pictures with Regan and said the sweetest things as we met her family. She and Regan are keeping in touch, and now Kathleen is encouraging Regan! This is just a neat reminder of how simple obedience is a picture of God's plan for good in our and othersâ€™ lives.
