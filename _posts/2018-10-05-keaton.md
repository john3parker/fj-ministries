# Keaton

the one who is always willing to jump in and play a game with anyone… He truly loves well and is such a loyal friend, an excellent listener, and a compassionate servant.
<!--break-->

He is in the midst of applying for colleges while taking 7 classes, including 5 AP courses. He just scored a **34 on his ACT** and had scored even higher on his PSAT than Tanner did (which got Tanner National Merit Finalist). Unfortunately for Keaton this year’s scores in Hawaii were higher, so his score just missed the cutoff for National Merit.

It was hard to do better than your big brother, who has always excelled, but then not to get the same recognition. We wanted to recognize Keaton here.
