# LIVING LOVE - CHANGING THE WORLD

It’s always a joy seeing the continued journeys of our families after Family DTS (an update written by one of our recent graduates..)

The sun comes up; it’s a new day dawning! His mercies are new every morning. It’s been a rough week. In fact it seems like everything is off the rails of late.  Transition time is harder than expected. I’m uncomfortable being comfortable. All the old things just aren’t important anymore. We’re missing the community of believers, the daily immersion in a life of serving and the energized spirit that results.

We are trying to get in a routine. Up early this morning to take Jade to basketball - the hustle and bustle of people in their routines, I felt like an alien listening to ungrateful conversations as I sat in Starbucks killing time. 

Reading my devotions, everything from the last week was answered in Colossians. All the questions and struggle was met with the exact encouragement as if it was written just to me. Suddenly everything was put into perspective again. 

There was a homeless man named Peter outside. I spoke to him and he asked if I could get him some food. It was funny because he told me he didn’t like Starbucks food… I asked him, how could I really help him? He said what he needed was a hoodie and a jacket since it’s cold and damp at night now. It just so happened that I had exactly that in my backpack for just such and occasion. It fit him perfectly and I was able to engage with him further, but after I came back out of the store he was gone. 

Sometimes I wonder if it’s a test. Maybe, maybe not, but Hebrews 13 gives us this instruction, “Keep on loving each other as brothers and sisters. Don’t forget to show hospitality to strangers, for some who have done this have entertained angels without realizing it! Remember those in prison, as if you were there yourself. Remember also those being mistreated, as if you felt their pain in your own bodies.”'

Enough said. -Dan Fofonove
