# Time to Reflect

It is a time to reflect and look forward. God is so faithful. He has consistently pursued us ever since Adam and Eve hid and when we each hide today. It is amazing to  ealize that we started our pursuit of missions and ministry 12 years ago and God continues to pour out His character into our lives. We are so grateful that his love never fails.

This year I taught in the Philippines, Korea, Kona, and Arkansas, and next year I am planning to train indigenous missionaries in Vietnam and the Philippines, and will also be teaching in Kona, California, and more. We can’t wait to see what God will do with the expanded Family DTS, not only here in Kona, but also in Chico, California, New Zealand, and Texas. It’s amazing to think that our second son will graduate high school, and we cannot wait to see where God will lead him.

With Tanner arriving late Thanksgiving night and 6 soccer games in a tournament over the weekend, we had a simple holiday dinner together on Sunday evening (upper right). Below is Tanner’s birthday dinner, to the left a picture of decorating the Christmas tree, and then we have the family pajamas...

## Vietnam
I was invited this week to teach in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam at the end of March 2019. I immediately knew in my heart that this was an open door I should walk through. To be able to teach in the first international DTS in Vietnam, training mostly indigenous missionaries in a communist country to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ, is a blessing that I long to receive. As the training program cannot afford to fly in international speakers, please consider helping send me to this amazing opportunity.
