FJ Ministries is the vision God laid on the hearts of Bryan and Tara Riley.

Their Mission of F.A.I.T.H. is “**F**amilies reaching families as **A**venues to the Nations, **I**gniting passion for God and compassion for people, **T**eaching and training with **H**earts and hands revealed.” Colossians 2:6.

They hope God will enable them to reach families and show that they too can participate in the Great Commission.  May their passion be for God and for serving others and in so doing encourage others to do the same. They have joined together with an organization known as YWAM to help them accomplish these goals.
