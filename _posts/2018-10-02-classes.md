# FAMILIES MATTER IN MISSIONS

The September Family DTS is coming along so well. A total of 9 staff families are leading out the 16 families who will be landing in Kona this Thursday. We've enjoyed training them and preparing them for what lies ahead. Below is a picture of the classroom.

We are excited to welcome 750 students on September 27th, who will train to go to the Nations in December. The new Family DTS has 16 families.
