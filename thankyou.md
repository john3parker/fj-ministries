<h1>Thank you for your generosity!</h1>
<div class="p-3">
<p>
We want to say thank you so much for your generous gift. Without your <strong>yes to God</strong> we could not do what we do. Your generosity enables our family and families around the world to take the good news of Jesus and his Word to the nations.
</p>
<p>
We are seeing dozens of families discipled to serve as missionaries on every continent through the work of this ministry. And every family you send demonstrates the gospel through the love of husbands, wives, moms and dads, and their children. Every family of five is five missionaries ready to change the world with the good news of Jesus.
</p>
<p>
We also are seeing so many families in crisis healed and restored to be able to minister to others as well. We want to keep working to see an end to divorce in the Body of Christ and to see every family in the world have a Bible and having heard the good news. 
</p>
<p>
Thank you again.
