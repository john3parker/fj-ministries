# Pregnancy Center Kona

One of our joys is helping serve the Pregnancy Center of Kona, with Bryan on its Board of Directors and Tara volunteering as a sonographer. We are opening a second center in Hilo, <!--break-->
so that now the entire island will have free services provided, along with the biblical value for life. In the first 10 months of this year 23 babies have been saved from abortion, 5 people accepted Jesus as Lord and Savior, and 200 families were provided services.

This year I taught in the Philippines, Korea, Kona, and Arkansas, and next year I am planning to train indigenous missionaries in Vietnam and the Philippines, and will also be teaching in Kona, California, and more. We can’t wait to see what God will do with the expanded Family DTS, not only here in Kona, but also in Chico, California, New Zealand, and Texas. It’s amazing to think that our second son will graduate high school, and we cannot wait to see where God will lead him.

With Tanner arriving late Thanksgiving night and 6 soccer games in a tournament over the weekend, we had a simple holiday dinner together on Sunday evening (upper right). Below is Tanner’s birthday dinner, to the left a picture of decorating the Christmas tree, and then we have the family pajamas...
