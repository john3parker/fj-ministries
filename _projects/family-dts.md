The Family Discipleship Training School is about reaching the nations and transforming communities by developing mission-minded families and launching healthy families into international missions.  Our goal is to see the end of divorce in the Body of Christ…

# Our Focus

<iframe width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/103874380"></iframe> Our goal is to see the end of divorce in the Body of Christ so that their marriages and families will bring glory to God in all that they do and so that future generations will be raised to know the Lord. The Family DTS is designed for married couples, with or without children.

The Discipleship Training School (DTS) is YWAM’s six month entry level course, embodying YWAM’s mission to know God and make Him known. DTS provides an environment for students to personally encounter Jesus Christ, learn to hear God’s voice, and respond with joy!

Our goal is to see the end of divorce in the Body of Christ so that their marriages and families will bring glory to God in all that they do and so that future generations will be raised to know the Lord. The Family DTS is designed for married couples, with or without children.

At the completion of the classroom phase, students have the opportunity to ‘make God known’ in the outreach phase. The Gospel comes alive as students step out in faith to preach the good news, baptize new believers and heal the sick (Mark 16:15-18). Outreach is an exhilarating time of risk and adventure, as teams serve with local believers: transforming lives and impacting society with the love of Jesus Christ.
