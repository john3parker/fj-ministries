# Traveling & Teaching
I (Bryan) arrive at XNA on October 12, after flying through San Francisco, Austin, and Houston! I will be teaching in Family DTS up until 2 hours before I fly. I will have my 30-year reunion Friday and Saturday and then will drive to Sherwood, AR to preach October 14.

I hope to connect with many of you in Arkansas during the week of the 15th and then will go to Dallas, TX for a missions event with Loren Cunningham, our Founder, and others like Francis Chan and Joe White. I will also visit a YWAM base in Tyler to discuss Family DTS.

The following week I plan to visit two additional YWAM bases in the Northeast and will see Tanner at Dartmouth. I then fly directly from Boston to Manila to teach a week in the Philippines, followed by a week of teaching in South Korea. Tara will be joining me in Korea, as we will teach in a number of churches in Daegu and will visit a couple of our past Family DTS families in Seoul.
